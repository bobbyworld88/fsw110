You can make an web applications 10x more responsive with JS. <br><br> By learning about the DOM, I learned how I could go to other cool websites to see their code. Also, I can modify the code and learn how to do something I didn't know how to do before. The hardest part for me was trying to figure out how to create elements from scratch and append them to the DOM. The cool thing I learned how the inspector and how to use it to make an responsive web application. <br><br> My most enjoyable, relieving and greatest accomplishment was making it to the end of the class without quiting. I struggling, I stressed, and I was really depressed but I fought through. No matter what I did my best.</p>
